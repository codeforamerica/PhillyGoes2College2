      <h4><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/style/images/homeTopReasonsHeader.gif" alt="Five Most Important Steps To Take If You Want To Go To College:" class="headline" /></h4>
      <ol>
        <li><span>If you&#8217;re in 9th grade, you should start to plan ahead NOW to choose the high school classes you will need to get into the college of your choice. Check with your college guidance counselor to make sure you&#8217;re on the right track.</span></li>
        <li><span>If you are in high school, you&#8217;ll need to take a college admission test to get admitted to college.  Take the PSATs (which is a practice test), prior to taking the SAT or ACT test. Check out the <a href="http://www.freelibrary.org">Free Library</a> near you for resources to study for the tests. They have books to help you study and also provide free SAT prep classes throughout the year. They provide free SAT prep classes and basic college prep workshops throughout the year.</span></li>
        <li><span>Paying for college is sometimes the biggest challenge for all students – whether you&#8217;re currently in school or not. You need to plan for how to pay for college way before you enroll.  </span></li>
        <li><span>If you need financial aid, the first step is to complete the FAFSA form (which stands for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid) to find out how much money you are eligible to receive to go to college. You can find information on organizations that can help by <a href="/students/find-ways-to-pay-for-college">clicking here</a>.</span></li>
        <li><span>Ask for help! Going to college can be confusing.  People want to help. If you don&#8217;t ask for guidance, you will never get it! There are on-line resources you can get through on this website by <a href="/students/connect-to-a-caring-adult">clicking here</a>. </span></li>
