  <p>Some times, the best way to take a journey into unfamiliar territory is connecting with someone who knows the terrain and can help guide each footstep. That caring adult could be your mother or father, or older relative or friend. There are also free places you can go where caring adults are ready, willing and able to help you.</p>
