            Part of the journey for going to college is having your student take responsibility for their own academic performance. Every Philadelphia public school student has access to <a href="http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/offices/s/studentnet"targe_blank>StudentNet</a>, an online portal that allows them to view their own academic record.

            On <a href="http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/offices/s/studentnet"targe_blank>StudentNet</a>, your student can view their academic records&hellip; including report cards, credit accumulation, current attendance record and scores on all benchmark and standardized assessments to let them (and you) know where they stand.
