  <p>Just about everybody gets some money to help them pay for college. But in order to find out how much you can get for college, you need to first determine what you&#8217;re eligible to receive. The first step is to complete the <a href="http://www.Fafsa.ed.gov">FAFSA form</a> (which stands for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid) to find out how much money you are eligible to receive to go to college. If you go to fill out a FAFSA form, you&#8217;ll need:</p>
  <ul class="bulletedList">
    <li>Your Social Security Number or Alien Registration Number if you&#8217;re not a U.S.citizen </li>
    <li>Your Driver&#8217;s License Number (if you have one)</li>
    <li>W-2 forms from the last two years</li>
    <li>Your 1040 Federal Tax Income Return (as well as your parents&#8217; tax return if you are a dependent child)</li>
    <li>Records of Untaxed Income (i.e., TANF, Social Security, Welfare or Veterans Benefits)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are organizations out there that can help you fill out these forms and let you know how much financial aid you can get to go to college. The <a href="http://www.fafsa4caster.ed.gov">FAFSA Forecaster</a><p>
      <a href="http://www.thebenefitbank.com/TaxCenter">The Benefit Bank</a> is a service available in the community that helps Philadelphians complete their taxes and apply for other services. People who use The Benefit Bank (TBB) to file their tax returns can use the TBB's auto-fill feature to automatically fill in the FAFSA form. 
      <p>
      The <a href="http://www.phillyfreetaxes.org/taxhelp/howtofile.asp">Campaign for Working Families</a> provides free tax completion assistance if your income meets certain guidelines. Some of their walk-in assistance sites will also help you complete the FAFSA.</p>
    <p>If you need assistance completing the FAFSA, you may attend one of the free workshops happening all over the city as part of the <a href="http://www.phillygoes2college.org/home/campaign" target=blank>City-Wide FAFSA Completion and Financial Aid Campaign</a>. <a href="/category/events/month">Check out our calendar</a> to find a workshop near you.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Remember, for anybody going to college &ndash; no matter what age &ndash; there are dollars available from at least three sources (after you determine what you&#8217;re eligible for): money from the state where you live, money from the federal government and scholarships from the college where you want to go to school. Here are the Top 5 things you need to do before you apply for any scholarship:</p>
  <ol class="cheatSheet">
    <li>
      <span>If you are applying for college scholarships and you also need financial aid, you must first complete the FAFSA application.  </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Your local library has books and information on scholarship information and is a great resource. <a href="/category/events/month">Check out free workshops</a> sponsored by the library on college-going topics.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Once you have been admitted to college, ask the financial aid specialists at that school if there are specific scholarships you may apply for.  Don&#8217;t assume they will just tell you!</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Each year millions of dollars in scholarships go unassigned.  Be careful to look at the criteria needed to apply such as age, race, religion, specific interest, etc.  There just might be a scholarship right for you!</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Scholarship providers do not charge a fee for submitting an application or recommending a scholarship to which you want to apply.  Beware of scams!</span>

 <p>
  Student loans can be a last resort to make up the difference between what you can afford to pay and the financial assistance you have received from the government, your college and private scholarships. Taking out loans can be scary, but most students have to borrow at least a small amount of money to pay for college. There is a <a href="http://www.direct.ed.gov/student.html" target=blank>federal loan program</a> just for students that offers low interest loans that you do not have to begin paying back until you are no longer in school. If you have to borrow, federal loans should be your first choice. 
  <p>
    There are two types of federal student loans, subsidized and unsubsidized. To find out which one you qualify for you will have to complete the FAFSA, information on the FAFSA is included at the top of this page. If your loan is subsidized, this means that the government will pay off the interest that is charged to your loan while you are in college. When you are out of college you will only be responsible for paying the exact amount that you borrowed. If your loan is unsubsidized you will be responsible for paying the interest that is charged to your loan, as well as the original amount you borrowed.
  <p>
    Parents may also borrow money to help pay for their student's education through the federal <a href="http://www.direct.ed.gov/parent.html" target=blank>Parent PLUS loan program</a>. Like federal student loans, Parent PLUS loans offer lower interest rates than loans from a bank.

  <span style="font-size:small"><strong>Loan Forgiveness</strong></span>
  <p>
  If you plan to go into public service, such as teaching or working for the government, you may be eligible for the <a href="http://www.finaid.org/loans/publicservice.phtml" target=blank>Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program</a>. This program offers loan forgiveness to individuals who have worked in public service positions for ten years while making payments on their loans. After ten years of payments, 120 payments, have been made the remainder of the loan will be forgiven. To count towards the 120, payments must have been made after October of 2007. <a href="http://www.phillygoes2college.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Public-Service-Loan-Forgiveness-Program.pdf" target=Blank>Click here to download a document with details.</a>
